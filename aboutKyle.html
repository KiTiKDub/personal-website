                                the user can choose from. The modules are draggable, which allows the user to rearrange how the input signal 
                                gets processed on the fly. Each module has it's own dry/wet mix, where 100% is only the distorted signal, and 
                                0% is the original signal. Each module can also have it's signal boosted before and after the module processes 
                                the input. Above, a frequency analyzer can be seen to get a rough idea of what your sound is doing. To the left, 
                                the two knobs control the width of the three bands. Allowing for boarder or more precise tuning. Each band can 
                                be bypassed, meaning all distortion effects are turned off, or muted, which complexly removes the signal in that 
                                band. Finally, the RMS values are displayed middle right. The user can also change the input signal before any 
                                processing, or after all processing, as well as the overall mix of the plugin. The user can also change the
                                plugin to be single band, which process the audio as a whole.

                                My 'Simple' Synth. This synth is equipped with two oscillators, which can each be made
                                into sine, saw, triangle, and square waves. An FM oscillator modulates the 1st oscillator, that can also be
                                made into the 4 waves of oscillator 1 and 2. There are three filter options, all that are run in series with
                                each other. There is a ladder filter, which incorporates, low, high, and band passes. A phaser filter, and a
                                comb filter. Below those are two LFO's, that can modulate most everything on the synth. The rate can be from
                                .1 to 10 hz, and have the same four types of waves. The bottom lines of knobs change when the filter type is
                                selected to match. Finally, at the top are global controls. These turn the oscillators on an off, the
                                filters on and off, as well as the global gain.

The button in the middle can be clicked to allow for different delay lengths in the left and right channels. The feedback increases the amound of the delayed signal that is feedback into the delay. There are two dry wet algorithms. One proportionally decreases the dry signal as the wet signal increases. The other increases the wet signal while the dry signal stays intact.
