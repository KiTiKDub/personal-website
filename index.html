                    <p>
                        <b>Hello! Welcome to my website!</b> </br> <br>
                        I graduated in 2019 from Purdue University with Bachlors in Mechanical Engineering. I have three years of expierence working at Newport News shipbuilding where I have carried the title of Systems Test Engineer, Structrual Enginner, Software Test Engineer, and Mechanical Engineer </br>
                        <ul>
                            <li> I worked as Test Engineer for 1.5 years on Los Angeles class submarines, namely the USS Columbus, Helena & Boise. I assisted the crew in completeion and verification of restoriation of said submarines. I ensured that all piping and electrical components of various sytems could handle the stress and strain of all sea and combat situations. </li> <br>
                            <li> I worked my last three jobs as apart of the rotational PEER Program at NNS. I held each position for 6 months. As a sctructual engineer, I worked upon the Navy's newest class of submarine, Columbia. My main project created a structual sound platform to ensure a 600 ton section of the submarine could be safetly stored and operated on for building. I also worked on various structures for various component transfers, such as loading of pumps and valves. </li> <br>
                            <li> As a software Test Engineer, I was responsible for testing of in house software that would control most valves, saftery systems, and electrical components on board the Ford class Aircraft Carriers. My primary responsibilities included developing test procedures to ensure that changes made to code and systems were functioning properly within the team. Once testing began, we would test each others procedures, and provide any solutions for bugs that were found. </li> <br>
                            <li> My current job as a Mechanical Engineer is checker for 3D drawings of piping and ventalition for the aircraft carrier Enterprise. I interface with developers of 3D drawings to verify that all dimensions, callouts, and all neccesary information for the trades to construct the aircraft carrier. </li> <br>
                        </ul>        
                    </p>

                        One of my main hobbies outside of work is to learn how to be a developer. <br> <br>
                        As you may be able to tell, this website was coded all from scratch and is hosted on my own domain. I love stretching my abilites to provide more value to all the people I work with. I also really enjoy developing because there are many logical aspects to it, but it still allows me to be creative with how I design my website or other programs. <br> <br>
                        Beyond website development, my main language that I have learned is C/C++. My favoirte side projects to work on are audio plugins. Under the 'Projects' tab you can check out what I have been working on. <br> <br>
                        One of my biggest dreams is to be able to have a job that allows me to use my techincal skills that I developed at Purdue, and be able to stretch myself with creative design and exploration through music and music application development. <br> <br>
                    </p>
        
                    <hr>
        
                    <p>
                        My other big hobby is creating music. <br> <br>
                        My main way of creating is producing on Ableton Live, mainly focusing on electronic music, but that develops as I develop. If you click the mask in the top right corner, that will take you to my landing page with more info and my music ready to play! <br> <br>
                        I really enjoy making music for the creative side of it. I have always learned to flex my analytical side, but I've neglected my creative side for most of my life. Music really stretches me in ways I could have never imagined. Not only do I think this is good for me as person, but I also believe it helps me be a better enginner and developer. <br> <br>
                        I'm sure its most kids dreams to become a rockstar, but the more I work on my own creative endevors, I wonder if I would want that to be my livlihood. Regardless, I love exploring, and I just can't wait to see where life takes me. <br> <br>
