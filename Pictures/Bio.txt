What's going on Railbreakers!?

My name is Kitik (KY-Tik) and I'm a dubstep DJ/Producer from Norfolk, VA! 
I've been producing for over two year now, and I like all things heavy! When it comes to my music, I like to experiment, and not to stick to one style of dubstep. I hope to always make something interesting and unique, instead of the same rhythms and basses you hear all the time. 

As I've developed over the past year, I've really taken a liking to orchestral heavy music. Think Lorna Shore, or SWARM. I hope to incorporate that soon as I move forward on my music journey, and really come into my own sound.  

I'm educated as a Mechanical Engineer, but I've always had a passion for music, and I don't want that passion to sit and waste away stuck in an office building all day. While I still have my day job, I hope to one day switch over to the world of music, and take the things I've learned from engineering and apply them in a new way to music.
